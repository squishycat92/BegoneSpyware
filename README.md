# BegoneSpyware
Don't you hate it when your teachers install useless extensions and policies that make your life harder through Chrome profiles? Perhaps they've installed spyware like GoGuardian that you don't like?

**Warning:** although I've tried my best to code the macOS version myself, I don't have a Mac to test it on and therefore it might be broken. Please let me know in the [issues](https://github.com/squishycat92/BegoneSpyware/issues) if you have a problem with any of the files! 

**Notice:** after installing this script, you will need to restart Google Chrome or manually go to chrome://policy and press "Reload Policies." In addition, you will most likely get a notice across all profiles saying that your browser is managed by your organization. This is completely normal and shows that the script is working.

**How it works:** this registry file simply locally sets all values that are typically used by teachers to take control of your device to null or unnoticeable values, overriding cloud policies. This effectively force overrides policies set by the school (usually through cloud policies).
